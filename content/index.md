
# Hi, I'm Minae.

I spun up this page using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator that's written with the Go programming language. You don't need to know Go to use it. I used a starter theme called [Ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke), the recommended theme from [Hugo's quick start documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy this single-page site, following [Hugo's instructions](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
